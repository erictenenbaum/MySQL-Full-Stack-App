# MySQL-Full-Stack-App

Very basic app with minimal styling. This app was built to gain practice in these areas:

1. Express Routing 
2. Working with a relational database (MySQL) - This app features a full CRUD
3. Building a custom ORM
4. Working with a templating engine - In this case it was handlebars.
